== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does niftyConnect send real notifications? =

Yes. niftyConnect sends email notifications through WordPress' `wp_mail()` system, Discord notifications through incoming webhooks, Telegram notifications through the Telegram Bot API, and WhatsApp notifications through Meta's official WhatsApp Cloud API.

= Can Discord notifications post into threads? =

Yes. Add a Discord thread ID in the Discord channel settings. A test-only thread ID can also be entered when sending a manual Discord test notification.

= Why does WhatsApp offer template and text modes? =

Automated business-initiated WhatsApp messages generally require an approved message template. Free-form text is intended for an open customer-service conversation window. Configure a fallback approved template in the WhatsApp channel settings, or choose a different approved template name, language, and body-variable layout for each event in the Templates tab.

= Can I test WhatsApp without a production WhatsApp Business number? =

Yes. Meta's WhatsApp Cloud API setup can provide a test business phone number, temporary access token, and phone number ID. Add and verify your personal WhatsApp number as an allowed test recipient, enter the test credentials in niftyConnect, and use Meta's pre-approved `hello_world` template with language `en_US` and no body variables.

= What format should WhatsApp phone numbers use? =

Enter the complete international number with its country code. Spaces, punctuation, and a leading `+` are removed when the number is saved. Do not enter a local number beginning with `0`.

= How are WhatsApp recipients selected? =

Role-based delivery uses the WhatsApp phone stored on each matching WordPress user profile. If no matching profile has a valid international number, niftyConnect uses the default recipient configured in the WhatsApp channel settings.

= Does WooCommerce need to be installed? =

No. WooCommerce hooks are registered safely and only send order notifications when WooCommerce is active.

= Can developers add custom channels? =

Yes. Use the `niftyconnect_register_providers` action and implement the `Provider_Interface` contract.

== Third-party services ==

niftyConnect is an independent plugin and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Discord, Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, Automattic, or WooCommerce.

niftyConnect can send Discord notifications only after an administrator configures an incoming Discord webhook URL. When Discord is enabled, the plugin sends the notification subject, notification body, optional webhook username, optional avatar URL, optional thread ID, and relevant event content to Discord's webhook API so Discord can post the message to the configured channel or thread. Depending on enabled triggers and templates, this may include site, post, comment, user, security, and WooCommerce order details. Webhook URLs can be stored in plugin settings or supplied through the `NIFTYCONNECT_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` constant in `wp-config.php`.

niftyConnect can send Telegram notifications only after an administrator enters a Telegram bot token and chat ID. When Telegram is enabled, the plugin sends the notification subject, notification body, and configured chat ID to the Telegram Bot API so Telegram can deliver the message. Depending on the enabled triggers and templates, the notification message may include site, post, comment, user, and WooCommerce order details selected in your notification template.

niftyConnect can send WhatsApp notifications only after an administrator configures a Meta access token, WhatsApp business phone number ID, recipient number, and message mode. When WhatsApp is enabled, the plugin sends the configured recipient phone number, notification subject and body, template details, and relevant event content to Meta's Graph API so WhatsApp can deliver the message. Depending on enabled triggers and templates, this may include site, post, comment, user, security, and WooCommerce order details. Access tokens can be stored in plugin settings or supplied through the `NIFTYCONNECT_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` constant in `wp-config.php`.
